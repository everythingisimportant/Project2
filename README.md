Hi, my name is Nhat.
I'm a telecom tester at TMA company, major in automation testing. Have knowledge in Git, CI/CD, Perl, Javascript.
My personal soft skills are very useful, helped me a lot at work. Specially in problem solving and English, I can figure out shortly root cause of the problem and get the content from document. I always treat the others with kindness and grateful, hope you are too :).

Cheers !
